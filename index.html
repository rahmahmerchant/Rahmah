	<h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Typing has become a daily aspect of our lives. Whether you're typing at school, work, or at home, chances are you would benefit from the faster speeds achieved through touch typing. Being a student in the 21st century where most of my work is done online, I know my life would be much easier if I could type faster. As a community, we must make an effort to teach the future generations the basic digital skill of typing. By having these children master typing early, we are preparing them for the digitized future, giving them better language skills, and allowing them to be as efficient as possible. </p>

  <div class="mainColumn">
	<h4>Technology In the Modern World Has Been On the Rise</h4>
    <p>Whether we like it or not, the use of technology in the modern world is on the rise. Digitization has occurred in many areas of our lives, including the workforce. According to an analysis conducted by Brookings Education,  between 2002 and 2016 the number of jobs that require low amounts of digital skills dropped from 56 percent to 30 percent while jobs that require high amounts of these skills jumped from 5 percent to 23 percent. With more jobs requiring high digital skills, it is critical that our future workforce is taught touch typing.

  <div class="body">
    <p>The increase use of technology has also been very apparent in the covid pandemic where access to a computer was not only a luxury, but a need for many. The government had to get involved by using the CARES ACT which used 30 billion dollars to get students computers and anything they needed to do online school. These students who might have never had a computer before were now using it everyday. Even after the pandemic is over, many of these students will continue to use computers and need to know how to type. Even before the pandemic, many schools had adopted online learning techniques. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2015,  80% of 8th grade students used a computer for school on a weekday. This means that students are already spending time at computers typing, but without learning how to type, they will take much longer to complete assignments. Besides school, these students need to have the skills to be competitive when they need to get a job. Since many jobs have at least some aspects of computer work, those who are able to type quickly will have an upper hand in their applications. By teaching kids typing, they can be guaranteed this upper hand by the time they are handing in resumes. The future generations have no choice but to live in a world that is surrounded by technology, so they need every digital skill they can get to be successful.  Even if these students don't end up having to type very often, typing can have other, less obvious benefits. 
    </p>
  	<h4>Expands Minds and Improv Language Skills</h4>
    <p>By doing activities required to learn to type correctly, children are expanding their mind and improving their language skills. A study done by  professors at Radboud University tested how narrative writing was improved by students just practicing typing for 20 minutes a day.  Over the course of two weeks, some students would practice typing while others did their normal print writing curriculum. At the end, these students were asked to describe a picture that was given to them. What was found was that the group that did practice typing had much more advanced descriptions and better spelling. While one of the reasons that this occurred was because of the typing lessons, another reason that the touch typing students performed better was because they were able to get their words down faster. When you are writing something, it is important to write as fast as you can so you can keep up with what you are thinking before you forget. When you write, of course you can write fast, but likely your handwriting will get sloppy. When typing, you are able to keep up with your thoughts while maintaining the same font. This information goes to further prove just how many benefits typing can provide students. Even with these benefits, some still don’t see the point in teaching touch typing. 
  	<h4>"But It's Not Necessary"</h4>
    <p>Even though the benefits of learning touch typing seem obvious, many believe that it is not necessary to teach. This comes from the fact being that computers are a common household item and students will learn to type on their own simply through exposure.  One of the studies that is used to back this view is one done by the American Psychological Association where they found that non-standard typists were only about 10 WPM (words per minute) less than those who used touch typing. While it is true that in perfect conditions, these two groups could perform almost the same, in speed. touch typists had a much higher accuracy rate then the nonstandard typists. Not to mention, non standard typists could only perform well if they had a view of the keyboard. Even if they will only be a bit faster than non standard typists, the students that learn touch typing will have an edge on accuracy which means they will spend less time having to go back and correct their work. Also by looking at the screen they are able to notice and fix mistakes as they make them which also saves time. </p>

	  <p>The world is ever evolving towards the direction of technology where typing is not only a valuable skill, but a needed one. This is why it is so important that we begin teaching young students to type as part of their school curriculum. As a community, we must voice our opinions to those in the Board of Education, or even just educators. This way, we can give our students all the tools they need to reach their full potential. After all, isn't that what school is about?</p>
